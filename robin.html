		<h1>Robin</h1>

		<p>Nico Robin, also known by her epithet <q>Devil Child</q> and the <q>Light of the Revolution</q>, is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. She is the sole survivor of the destroyed island of Ohara, which was located in the West Blue. As a result, she is currently the only person in the world with the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.  She is the seventh member of the crew, the sixth to join, and like Nami, is the second to rejoin, doing so near the end of the Enies Lobby Arc. Robin is also the first member to have once been an antagonist. She ate the Hana Hana no Mi.  Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history.</p>
