		<h1>Sanji</h1>

		<p><q>Black Leg</q> Sanji, born as <em>Vinsmoke Sanji</em>, is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the former sous chef of the Baratie. He is also the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family, thus making him a prince of the Germa Kingdom, until he officially disowned them twice.  He is officially the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Since he was born in North Blue, he is the first Straw Hat not to originate from East Blue.  His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife.</p>
