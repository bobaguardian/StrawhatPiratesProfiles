		<h1>Usopp</h1>

		<p><q>God</q> Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. He was born in Syrup Village and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. Despite his normal cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.  He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the <em>Post-Enies Lobby Arc</em>.</p>
